Whatsup people! It's been real long since i've written something. So here i am with a small **docker-compose based project** that would teach you how we can orchestrate docker containers.

## What is Docker Compose???

It's not a big deal, docker compose just helps you run multiple containers in one go using a simple yaml manifest. Let's see how we can implement in a <mark>real life project</mark>.

## Prerequisites!

* Docker (of-course :p)
    
* Preferably ubuntu (the commands and files used in the blog are written based on ubuntu)
    
* Git
    

Some enthusiasm and you're good to go.

## The Goal:

is to deploy a reddit clone application on a container using dicker-compose.

1. Build a docker image
    
2. Push it to docker container registry, dockerhub
    
3. Make a docker-compose.yaml file
    
4. Use it to orchestrate multiple services, set up networks, and volumes.
    

# Let's Get Started!

### Clone into the repo!!

* clone the repo into your local machine. In this case we are using a reddit-clone application.:https://github.com/g4ze/reddit-clone-deploy
    

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/g4ze/reddit-clone-deploy
$ cd reddit-clone-deploy
```

### Let's build and deploy image!

* Since our goal is to deploy the app's image on dockerhub as well, it's necessary to build a good lightweight image out of it.
    
* The repository we just cloned into already contains a ready-to-build dockerfile.
    
* ```yaml
          FROM node:19-alpine3.15
          
          WORKDIR /reddit-clone
          
          COPY . /reddit-clone
          RUN npm install 
          
          EXPOSE 3000
          CMD ["npm","run","dev"]
    ```
    
    Pretty basic stuff here, copying the directory, installing npm, exposing port 300 and running.
    
* Build it from the terminal, make sure you're in the right directory!
    
* ```bash
        $ docker build -t reddit .
    ```
    
    A simple `docker images` would show something like:
    
* ```bash
        $  sudo docker images
        REPOSITORY     TAG             IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
        reddit         latest          e032a908867c   13 minutes ago   760MB
    ```
    
    Great! Now that we've built our image, let's just simply deploy it on docker hub:
    

```bash
  $ sudo docker push g4ze/reddit:latest
```

### Writing the docker-compose file:

This is how the docker compose fill should like for the app we a re using:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  reddit-clone:
    image: your-image-name
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    working_dir: /reddit-clone
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
    command: npm run dev
```

* `version: '3'` means that the version of docker compose format we are using is 3
    
* `services:`**:**
    
    * Defines a list of services. In this case, there is one service named `reddit-clone`.
        
* `reddit-clone:`**:**
    
    * The name of the service. This name is used to reference the service within the Docker Compose file.
        
* `image: your-image-name`**:**
    
    * Specifies the Docker image to use for the service. Replace `your-image-name` with the actual name or ID of the Docker image you want to use. This image is the base for your service.
        
* `ports:`**:**
    
    * Defines port mappings between the host and the container. In this case, it maps port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on the host (`"3000:3000"`). This allows you to access your Node.js application running in the container on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) on the host machine.
        
* `working_dir: /reddit-clone`**:**
    
    * Sets the working directory inside the container to `/reddit-clone`. This is the directory where your application code is expected to be.
        
* `environment:`**:**
    
    * Allows you to set environment variables for the container. In this case, it sets `NODE_ENV` to `development`. This is commonly used to configure the runtime environment for your application.
        
* `command: npm run dev`**:**
    
    * Specifies the command to run when the container starts. In this case, it runs the `npm run dev` command, which is typically used to start a Node.js development server.
        

In summary, this Docker Compose file defines a service named `reddit-clone` based on a Docker image specified by `your-image-name`. It maps port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on the host, sets the working directory to `/reddit-clone`, sets the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development`, and runs the `npm run dev` command when the container starts. This configuration is suitable for a Node.js application, especially during development.

### Finale:

Now that we have out image built, docker compose file ready and our hopes high, let's dive right into our final command:

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose up
```

It it wroks, congrats, you can access the application on your localhost: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

That's it guys, you now have another small devops project on your github profile. Explore more to unlock more potential.

Have fun!
